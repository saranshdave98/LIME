LIME: Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation
This is a python implementation of the paper - http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/publication/LIME-tip.pdf

The implementation is done using 2 algorithms.
1. Exact Solver
2. Sped-Up Solver

Note: The test images are taken from https://sites.google.com/view/xjguo/lime

Sped-Up Solver is implemented using this paper - http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2768&rep=rep1&type=pdf

To run this program, execute code.py and wait for the output images to show up. After the first outputs are displayed, close the output image windows and wait for the next set of outputs. (Note: there are 2 sample outputs in total)

If you face any issues running the python executable, please run the individual python notebooks to go through the algorithms.
